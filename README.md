# Phantom UI

My personal sandbox for design system work (React UI component library).

[![Checked with Biome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Checked_with-Biome-60a5fa?style=flat&logo=biome)](https://biomejs.dev)

## About

Professionally, I am a (true) Full-Stack Engineer, but I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make front-end development easier for back-end developers.
This repository provides a sandbox for me to try out ideas using purely open source tooling.
I hope to explore multi-platform apps and use this Design System for my own hobby applications.

If any of these ideas interest you, reach out via Discussions.

Cheers,
@connorjs

P.S.
Due to my active work, this sandbox assumes React (although I love the idea of [Qwik](https://qwik.dev) and similar tools).
